        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight text-justify"><b>Sempervivums</b>, also known as Houseleeks or
          Hens and Chicks, are succulent perennials that form rosettes of succulent leaves that will often spread fast
          to form mats. They tend to spread rapidly in favourable conditions via offsets and are valued as a ground
          cover for dry, sunny locations. Their ability to store water in their thick leaves allow them to live in sunny
          and rocky places through out mountains. Most are hardy to US zone 4, and will handle warm climates to about
          zone 8. Sempervivum grow as tufts of perennial but monocarpic rosettes. Each rosette propagates asexually by
          lateral rosettes or offsets. </p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight text-justify"> Typically, each plant grows for several years
          before flowering. </p>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight text-justify">The colour of the flowers is reddish, yellowish,
          pinkish, or seldomly, whitish. In Sempervivum, the flowers are actinomorphic (like a star) and have more than
          six petals. After flowering, the plant dies, usually leaving many offsets it has produced during its life.
          I get quite a few emails from concerned succulent lovers, asking why their beloved plants are dying. Sometimes
          there’s actually nothing wrong with their plants.
          Sempervivums also make suitable plants for containers, and do well in breathable terracotta, concrete, and
          cement pots. They have also been known to grow in rock crevices, metal containers,
          succulent wreaths, roof shingles, and anywhere else that allows adequate root drainage.</p>
